<this book is a slice of intensified history as i saw it .>
<it does not pretend to be anything but a detailed account of the november revolution , when the bolsheviki , at the head of the workers and soldiers , seized the state power of russia and placed it in the hands of the soviets .>
<naturally most of it deals with " red petrograd " , the capital and heart of the insurrection .>
<but the reader must realize that what took place in petrograd was almost exactly duplicated , with greater or lesser intensity , at different intervals of time , all over russia .>
<in this book , the first of several which i am writing , i must confine myself to a chronicle of those events which i myself observed and experienced , and those supported by reliable evidence ; preceded by two chapters briefly outlining the background and causes of the november revolution .>
<i am aware that these two chapters make difficult reading , but they are essential to an understanding of what follows .>
<many questions will suggest themselves to the mind of the reader .>
<what is bolshevism ? what kind of a governmental structure did the bolsheviki set up ? if the bolsheviki championed the constituent assembly before the november revolution , why did they disperse it by force of arms afterward ? and if the bourgeoisie opposed the constituent assembly until the danger of bolshevism became apparent , why did they champion it afterward ?>
<these and many other questions cannot be answered here .>
<in another volume , " kornilov to brest - litovsk " , i trace the course of the revolution up to and including the german peace .>
<there i explain the origin and functions of the revolutionary organisations , the evolution of popular sentiment , the dissolution of the constituent assembly , the structure of the soviet state , and the course and outcome of the brest - litovsk negotiations . . .>
<in considering the rise of the bolsheviki it is necessary to understand that russian economic life and the russian army were not disorganised on november 7th , 1917 , but many months before , as the logical result of a process which began as far back as 1915 .>
<the corrupt reactionaries in control of the tsar’s court deliberately undertook to wreck russia in order to make a separate peace with germany .>
<the lack of arms on the front , which had caused the great retreat of the summer of 1915 , the lack of food in the army and in the great cities , the break - down of manufactures and transportation in 1916 - all these we know now were part of a gigantic campaign of sabotage .>
<this was halted just in time by the march revolution .>
<for the first few months of the new régime , in spite of the confusion incident upon a great revolution , when one hundred and sixty millions of the world’s most oppressed people suddenly achieved liberty , both the internal situation and the combative power of the army actually improved .>
<but the " honeymoon " was short . the propertied classes wanted merely a political revolution , which would take the power from the tsar and give it to them .>
<they wanted russia to be a constitutional republic , like france or the united states ; or a constitutional monarchy , like england .>
<on the other hand , the masses of the people wanted real industrial and agrarian democracy .>
<william english walling , in his book , " russia’s message " , an account of the revolution of 1905 , describes very well the state of mind of the russian workers , who were later to support bolshevism almost unanimously :>
<they ( the working people ) saw it was possible that even under a free government , if it fell into the hands of other social classes , they might still continue to starve . . .>
<the russian workman is revolutionary , but he is neither violent , dogmatic , nor unintelligent .>
<he is ready for barricades , but he has studied them , and alone of the workers of the world he has learned about them from actual experience .>
<he is ready and willing to fight his oppressor , the capitalist class , to a finish .>
<but he does not ignore the existence of other classes .>
<he merely asks that the other classes take one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws near . . .>
<they ( the workers ) were all agreed that our ( american ) political institutions were preferable to their own , but they were not very anxious to exchange one despot for another ( i . e . , the capitalist class ) . . .>
<the workingmen of russia did not have themselves shot down , executed by hundreds in moscow , riga and odessa , imprisoned by thousands in every russian jail , and exiled to the deserts and the arctic regions , in exchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of goldfields and cripple creek . . .>
<and so developed in russia , in the midst of a foreign war , the social revolution on top of the political revolution , culminating in the triumph of bolshevism .>
<mr . a . j . sack , director in this country of the russian information bureau , which opposes the soviet government , has this to say in his book , " the birth of the russian democracy " :>
<the bolsheviks organised their own cabinet , with nicholas lenine as premier and leon trotsky - minister of foreign affairs .>
<the inevitability of their coming into power became evident almost immediately after the march revolution .>
<the history of the bolsheviki , after the revolution , is a history of their steady growth . . .>
<foreigners , and americans especially , frequently emphasise the " ignorance " of the russian workers .>
<it is true they lacked the political experience of the peoples of the west , but they were very well trained in voluntary organisation .>
<in 1917 there were more than twelve million members of the russian consumers’ cooperative societies ; and the soviets themselves are a wonderful demonstration of their organising genius .>
<moreover , there is probably not a people in the world so well educated in socialist theory and its practical application .>
<william english walling thus characterises them :>
<the russian working people are for the most part able to read and write .>
<for many years the country has been in such a disturbed condition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only of intelligent individuals in their midst , but of a large part of the equally revolutionary educated class , who have turned to the working people with their ideas for the political and social regeneration of russia . . .>
<many writers explain their hostility to the soviet government by arguing that the last phase of the russian revolution was simply a struggle of the " respectable " elements against the brutal attacks of bolshevism .>
<however , it was the propertied classes , who , when they realised the growth in power of the popular revolutionary organisations , undertook to destroy them and to halt the revolution .>
<to this end the propertied classes finally resorted to desperate measures .>
<in order to wreck the kerensky ministry and the soviets , transportation was disorganised and internal troubles provoked ; to crush the factory - shop committees , plants were shut down , and fuel and raw materials diverted ; to break the army committees at the front , capital punishment was restored and military defeat connived at .>
<this was all excellent fuel for the bolshevik fire .>
<the bolsheviki retorted by preaching the class war , and by asserting the supremacy of the soviets .>
<between these two extremes , with the other factions which whole - heartedly or half - heartedly supported them , were the so - called " moderate " socialists , the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries , and several smaller parties .>
<these groups were also attacked by the propertied classes , but their power of resistance was crippled by their theories .>
<roughly , the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries believed that russia was not economically ripe for a social revolution - that only a " political " revolution was possible .>
<according to their interpretation , the russian masses were not educated enough to take over the power ; any attempt to do so would inevitably bring on a reaction , by means of which some ruthless opportunist might restore the old régime .>
<and so it followed that when the " moderate " socialists were forced to assume the power , they were afraid to use it .>
<they believed that russia must pass through the stages of political and economic development known to western europe , and emerge at last , with the rest of the world , into full - fledged socialism .>
<naturally , therefore , they agreed with the propertied classes that russia must first be a parliamentary state - though with some improvements on the western democracies .>
<as a consequence , they insisted upon the collaboration of the propertied classes in the government .>
<from this it was an easy step to supporting them .>
<the " moderate " socialists needed the bourgeoisie .>
<but the bourgeoisie did not need the " moderate " socialists .>
<so it resulted in the socialist ministers being obliged to give way , little by little , on their entire program , while the propertied classes grew more and more insistent .>
<and at the end , when the bolsheviki upset the whole hollow compromise , the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries found themselves fighting on the side of the propertied classes . . .>
<in almost every country in the world to - day the same phenomenon is visible .>
<instead of being a destructive force , it seems to me that the bolsheviki were the only party in russia with a constructive program and the power to impose it on the country .>
<if they had not succeeded to the government when they did , there is little doubt in my mind that the armies of imperial germany would have been in petrograd and moscow in december , and russia would again be ridden by a tsar . . .>
<it is still fashionable , after a whole year of the soviet government , to speak of the bolshevik insurrection as an " adventure " .>
<adventure it was , and one of the most marvellous mankind ever embarked upon , sweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses , and staking everything on their vast and simple desires .>
<already the machinery had been set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributed among the peasants .>
<the factory - shop committees and the trade unions were there to put into operation workers’ control of industry .>
<in every village , town , city , district and province there were soviets of workers’ , soldiers’ and peasants’ deputies , prepared to assume the task of local administration .>
<no matter what one thinks of bolshevism , it is undeniable that the russian revolution is one of the great events of human history , and the rise of the bolsheviki a phenomenon of world - wide importance .>
<just as historians search the records for the minutest details of the story of the paris commune , so they will want to know what happened in petrograd in november , 1917 , the spirit which animated the people , and how the leaders looked , talked and acted .>
<it is with this in view that i have written this book .>
<in the struggle my sympathies were not neutral .>
<but in telling the story of those great days i have tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter , interested in setting down the truth .>
<to the average reader the multiplicity of russian organisations - political groups , committees and central committees , soviets , dumas and unions - will prove extremely confusing .>
<for this reason i am giving here a few brief definitions and explanations .>
<in the elections to the constituent assembly , there were seventeen tickets in petrograd , and in some of the provincial towns as many as forty ; but the following summary of the aims and composition of political parties is limited to the groups and factions mentioned in this book .>
<only the essence of their programmes and the general character of their constituencies can be noticed . . .>
<russian meetings and conventions are organised after the continental model rather than our own .>
<the first action is usually the election of officers and the " presidium " .>
<the " presidium " is a presiding committee , composed of representatives of the groups and political factions represented in the assembly , in proportion to their numbers .>
<the " presidium " arranges the order of business , and its members can be called upon by the president to take the chair " pro tem " .>
<each question ( " vopros " ) is stated in a general way and then debated , and at the close of the debate resolutions are submitted by the different factions , and each one voted on separately .>
<the order of business can be , and usually is , smashed to pieces in the first half hour .>
<on the plea of " emergency " , which the crowd almost always grants , anybody from the floor can get up and say anything on any subject .>
<the crowd controls the meeting , practically the only functions of the speaker being to keep order by ringing a little bell , and to recognise speakers .>
<almost all the real work of the session is done in caucuses of the different groups and political factions , which almost always cast their votes in a body and are represented by floor - leaders .>
<the result is , however , that at every important new point , or vote , the session takes a recess to enable the different groups and political factions to hold a caucus .>
<the crowd is extremely noisy , cheering or heckling speakers , over - riding the plans of the " presidium " .>
<among the customary cries are : " prosim ! " " please ! go on ! " " pravilno ! " or " eto vierno ! that's true ! right ! " " do volno ! enough ! " " doloi ! down with him ! " " posor ! shame ! " and " teesche ! silence ! not so noisy ! ">
<the word " soviet " means " council " .>
<under the tsar the imperial council of state was called " gosudarstvennyi soviet " .>
<since the revolution , however , the term " soviet " has come to be associated with a certain type of parliament elected by members of working - class economic organisations - the soviet of workers' , of soldiers' , or of peasants' deputies .>
<i have therefore limited the word to these bodies , and wherever else it occurs i have translated it " council " .>
<besides the local " soviets " , elected in every city , town and village of russia - and in large cities , also ward ( raionny ) " soviets " - there are also the " oblastne " or " gubiernsky " ( district or provincial ) " soviets " , and the central executive committee of the all - russian " soviets " in the capital , called from its initials " tsay - ee - kah " .>
<almost everywhere the " soviets " of workers' and of soldiers' deputies combined very soon after the march revolution .>
<in special matters concerning their peculiar interests , however , the workers' and the soldiers' sections continued to meet separately .>
<the " soviets " of peasants' deputies did not join the other two until after the bolshevik " coup d'etat " .>
<they , too , were organised like the workers and soldiers , with an executive committee of the all - russian peasants' " soviets " in the capital .>
<although mostly industrial in form , the russian labour unions were still called trade unions , and at the time of the bolshevik revolution had from three to four million members .>
<these unions were also organised in an all - russian body , a sort of russian federation of labour , which had its central executive committee in the capital .>

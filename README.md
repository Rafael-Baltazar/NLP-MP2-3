NLP-MP2-3
=========

System that recognizes the language of a given text.

There are two versions of the program:
	- One version that calculates the probability of a text being of a certain language, without using any smoothing techniques.
	- Another version that calculates the same probability, but uses the Add-One (Laplace) smoothing technique, to eliminate zeros.
